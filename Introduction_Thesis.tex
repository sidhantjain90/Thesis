\section{General Introduction}
Plasmas exist in several forms in the Universe such as surface of the sun, interstellar gaseous clouds. They can also be observed near Earth's surface in the form of Lightning strikes, sprites and auroras. However, they do not exist naturally on Earth and hence created artificially by humans for various scientific and commercial purposes. A Plasma is formed when a medium (gas) is provided with sufficient energy (here electric field) to remove electrons from atoms of the medium. This energy may be provided by application of an electric field, joule heating or other sources such as cosmic rays. So, Plasmas primarily consists of electrons, positively charged ions and neutrals.

Plasmas can be classified into two types based on relative temperatures of electrons, ions and neutrals, namely, thermal and non-thermal plasmas. In thermal plasmas, the electrons are in thermal equilibrium with the positive ions. In non-thermal plasma, the temperature of the electron is much higher than than those of the ions and neutrals. This is because the energy transfer from applied electric field to electrons is much faster than the energy loss due to collisional energy transfer between electrons and ions or heavy species. This is due to the relatively smaller mass of the electrons. Non-Equilibrium Plasmas also referred as Cold Plasmas have several applications such as plasma-assisted combustion, air purification, ozone production, etc.

The phenomenon of Non-Equilibrium cold plasmas is studied with the help of a theory developed by Loeb and Meek \cite{Loeb and Meek , 1940a and 1940b} who described the formation of a highly non-linear space charge waves before the occurence of electrical breakdown, which creates an internal electric field of its own, comparable to the applied (external) field. These space charge waves are commonly known as streamers. Streamers are considered as the precursors to spark discharges, lightening\cite{Bazelyan et Raizer 2000} and sprites \cite{Franz et al 1990; Bourdon et al 2007}. They are able to initiate spark discharges in relatively shorter gaps i.e several centimetres, at near ground pressures in air.  

Several attempts were made in order to model analytically the various quantitative properties of the streamers \cite{Davies, Davies, Evans, 1971}.Two main problems hampered the analytical modeling streamers. First was that problem was atleast 2-D. Second was that there are steep gradients which are difficult to capture. Dhali and Williams proposed a numerical approach to the problem as a 2-D numerical model using drift-diffusion equations for electrons and positive ions coupled with Poisson's equation for Electric Field to describe the streamer propagation. They used a Flux-Corrected Transport technique to deal with the steep gradients. A more detailed description can be found in their paper \cite{Dhalli 1987}. The FCT technique was further implemented by Kushner's team \cite{Kushner et al 1989} to study the electron-velocity distribution (kinetic model). But solving Boltzmann equations using kinetic model proves to be very time consuming. FCT was also implemented by Morrow's team to study streamer propagation between point-plane gap in air \cite{Morrow et al, 1997}. Kulikovsky proposed a numerical model on assumption of a cylindrical streamer head \cite{Kulikovsky 1994} and further developed the theory by indicating the exponential growth of streamer velocity and radius with time \cite{KuliKovsky 1997}. 



A numerical study on both positive and negative streamers was done by Babaeva et al \cite{Babaeva et al 1997} for a wide range of applied electric fields.     




Challenges occurring in numerically modeling streamers.

\section{Important processes in discharges}
A gaseous medium such as air always contain some ions and electrons. This is due to natural processes such as cosmic radiation, photoionization, etc. When an electric field is applied to the gas, it accelerates these electrons and ions . As electrons move through the medium they collide with neutral atoms or molecules. Important collisions are:

1. Impact Ionization:

2. Recombination:

3. Excitation:

4. Attachment:



\section{Electron Avalanche}

If the energy acquired by a single electron is more than the ionization potential , it knocks off another electron from a neutral molecule. As a consequence, two slow electrons are accelerated further by the reigning electric field. Until the breakdown value of electric field has been achieved, there is a balance between the production of electrons (due to impact ionization) and loss of electrons (due to attachment). Above the breakdown field, the number of electrons start to increase exponentially giving rise to a phenomenon known as avalanche.

\section{Avalanche to Streamer Transition}


\section{Streamer Discharge Mechanism}

Streamers are thin ionized plasma channels formed between two oppositely charged electrodes when space charge field become comparable to the external electric field (Meek's criterion). They can propagate to either direction i.e towards anode or cathode as a result of distortion of the external electric field. They occur before the complete breakdown of a gas or dieclectric medium. Hence, they are also referred as precursors of electrical breakdown.
